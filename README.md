# Projects-In-Operating-Systems---Scheduling-Algorithms
Simulation of FIFO, SJF, SRT, and MLF scheduling algorithms

In this project, I simulated the following scheduling algorithms: First In First Out, Shortest Job First, Shortest Remaining Time, and Multi Level Feedback Queue. My program parses a text document containing a single line of numbers, with each pair of numbers representing a process's arrival time and run time. For each algorithm, the program simulates all given processes and outputs a new line with average turnaround time and the real time for each process provided. This information is saved to a file labeled 78552559.txt (my UCI student ID). 

From this project I gained a greater understanding of the efficiency of various scheduling algorithms. This improved my ability to write programs that multitask well and provided me with a greater understanding of the inner workings of operating systems.
